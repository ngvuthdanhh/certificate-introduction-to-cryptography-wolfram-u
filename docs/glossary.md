# ðŸ“” Glossary â€“ Cryptography Terms

- **Cipher**: An algorithm for performing encryption or decryption.
- **Plaintext**: Original readable data.
- **Ciphertext**: Encrypted data, unreadable without a key.
- **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Uses a public/private key pair.
- **RSA**: A widely used public-key cryptosystem.
- **AES**: Advanced Encryption Standard, the most common block cipher.
