# ðŸ”‘ Key Exchange Simulations

## Objective
Understand how secure key exchange works in practice.

---

## 1. Diffieâ€“Hellman Key Exchange
- Choose small prime `p = 23`, generator `g = 5`.
- Aliceâ€™s secret: `a = 6`, Bobâ€™s secret: `b = 15`.
- Compute public values and shared key.

---

## 2. Elliptic Curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH)
- Curve: `y^2 = x^3 + 7` (secp256k1, simplified example).
- Alice picks private key `a = 7`.
- Bob picks private key `b = 11`.
- Simulate key exchange.

---

âœ… Deliverable: Show public values and shared secret.
