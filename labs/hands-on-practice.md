# ðŸ§ª Hands-on Practice

## Objective
Apply cryptographic concepts in real-world tools.

---

## 1. Hashing
- Use SHA-256 to hash: `WolframCryptography`.
- Verify output against online tools.

---

## 2. Digital Signatures
- Generate RSA key pair.
- Sign the message: `Hello Wolfram U`.
- Verify using the public key.

---

## 3. TLS Handshake Demo
- Use `openssl s_client -connect example.com:443`.
- Observe the handshake process, exchanged certificates, and negotiated cipher suite.

---

## 4. Attack Awareness
- Try encrypting two messages with the same RC4 key.
- Show why it is insecure (key reuse vulnerability).
