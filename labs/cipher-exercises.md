# üîê Cipher Exercises

## Objective
Practice classical and modern ciphers to understand the fundamentals of encryption and decryption.

---

## 1. Caesar Cipher
- Implement Caesar cipher with a shift of 3.
- Encrypt and decrypt: `HELLO WORLD`.

---

## 2. Vigen√®re Cipher
- Key: `WOLFRAM`
- Message: `CRYPTOGRAPHY`
- Encrypt & decrypt.

---

## 3. Transposition Cipher
- Use rail fence cipher (depth = 3).
- Encrypt: `SECURECOMMUNICATION`.

---

## 4. Block Cipher Simulation
- Encrypt `10110011` with a toy substitution-permutation network.
- Show all rounds and key mixing.
