# 11 â€“ Quantum Cryptography

## Core Idea
- Uses quantum mechanics for secure communication.
- No-cloning theorem ensures security.

## Example
- Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with BB84 protocol.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography
- Research into lattice-based, code-based, and hash-based cryptography.
