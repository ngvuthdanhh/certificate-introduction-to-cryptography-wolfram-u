# ðŸ“‚ Case Studies in Cryptography

## 1. Enigma Machine (WWII)
- Used by German military for secure communications.
- Broken by Alan Turing and colleagues at Bletchley Park.
- Importance: highlighted the role of cryptanalysis in warfare.

---

## 2. DES and the Rise of AES
- DES (56-bit key) adopted in 1977.
- Broken by brute force (EFF DES Cracker, 1998).
- Replaced with AES (128/192/256-bit keys).

## 3. MD5 and SHA-1 Collisions
- MD5 collisions discovered in 2004.
- SHA-1 collision published by Google & CWI in 2017.
- Lesson: algorithms can degrade over time, migration is essential.

---

## 4. Quantum Threat to RSA/ECC
- Shorâ€™s algorithm (1994) â†’ breaks RSA/ECC if quantum computers scale.
- Push for post-quantum cryptography (lattice-based, code-based, hash-based).

âœ… These cases illustrate the **evolution of security and the importance of updating cryptographic standards**.
