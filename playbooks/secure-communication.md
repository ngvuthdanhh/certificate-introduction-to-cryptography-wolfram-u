# üîê Playbook: Secure Communication Practices

This playbook outlines how to apply cryptographic principles to secure everyday communication.

---

## 1. Email Security
- Use **PGP/GPG** for end-to-end encryption.
- Verify sender identity via **digital signatures**.
- Avoid sending plaintext sensitive data.

---

## 2. Messaging Apps
- Prefer **Signal, WhatsApp, or Telegram (secret chats)** ‚Üí they use **end-to-end encryption**.
- Enable **disappearing messages** for sensitive contexts.
- Avoid SMS for confidential information.

---

## 3. File Security
- Encrypt files before uploading to cloud storage (e.g., using **VeraCrypt** or **7-Zip AES-256**).
- Use **checksums/hashes (SHA-256)** to verify file integrity.
- Apply access control (password-protect sensitive archives).

---

## 4. Web Browsing
- Always use **HTTPS (TLS 1.3 preferred)**.
- Validate certificates before transmitting data.
- Consider **VPN** or **Tor** for private browsing.

---

‚úÖ **Best Practice:** Combine encryption with good authentication & key management.
